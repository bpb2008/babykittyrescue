        <h2> WHO WE ARE </h2>
        <p>
          When a stray cat becomes pregnant, the kittens she bears may become
          orphaned, requiring special attention. Separated before weaning from
          their mothers, these vulnerable neonatal kittens require
          around-the-clock bottle feeding and other care. Often, this kind of
          support is unavailable at local animal shelters experiencing strained
          resources. This makes saving newborn feral kittens extremely
          difficult. We founded the Baby Kitty Rescue Committee to bridge gaps
          in support for newborn stray kittens in the Seattle, Washington area
          by offering them essential neonatal care. We take in and nurture
          newborn stray kittens, offering them the extensive care they need to
          survive and grow into healthy 8-week-old weaned kittens. Once they are
          old enough to eat on their own and regulate their own body
          temperature, they will be moved to a special lounge where they can
          greet potential human companions as they are made available for
          adoption. We also educate the community on how to handle stray newborn
          kittens and their mothers while providing volunteer opportunities for
          animal lovers who want to learn how to care for orphaned neonatal
          kittens. Baby Kitty Rescue Committee was founded by Angela Truong,
          whose volunteer work in the neonatal ward of Austin Pets Alive sparked
          a dream to open her own rescue focusing on neonatal kittens. Our goal
          is to offer a unique service that complements other animal rescues and
          shelters by maintaining a laser focus on only intaking and caring for
          neonatal orphans. We want to ensure that they are comfortable in an
          environment similar to a home to prepare them to live with their
          forever families. As we grow, we hope to replicate our model in
          surrounding cities, with a larger vision to achieve no-kill status and
          save every feral newborn kitten we can. Baby Kitty Rescue Committee is
          a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation.

        <h2> OUR MISSION </h2>
        <p>
          Baby Kitty Rescue Committee is a nonprofit initiative founded to
          bridge gaps in essential care for newborn stray kittens in the
          Seattle, Washington area. We rescue and nurture orphaned newborn
          kittens, offering them the extensive care they need to survive and
          grow. Once they are old enough to eat on their own and regulate their
          own body temperature, they will be moved to a special lounge where
          they can greet potential human companions as they are made available
          for adoption. Our goal is to offer a service that complements other
          local animal rescues and shelters by focusing on only the intake and
          care of neonatal orphans. We want to do everything we can to ensure
          they are prepared to thrive in their forever homes.
